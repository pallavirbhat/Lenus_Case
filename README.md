### Feature Selection for Classification Model

The code is divided into the following sections with notes / observations after each output:

Data Preparation
1. Preprocessing
- Data granularity and keys understanding
- Missing values analysis, imputation and evalutation
- Outlier / junk values detection and treatment
  
2. Exploratory Data Analaysis
- Univariate distributions 
- Bivariate analysis 
- Barplots for categorical features (X-y)
- Scatterplots and histograms for numerical features (X-X and X-y)

Feature Selection (and Model Development)

3. Heuristic Methods
- Vizualisations
- Statistical Measures
- Correlations
- Variance Inflation Factor 

4. Filter Methods
- ANOVA Test for continuous features
- Chi-Square Test for categorical features
   
5. Embedded Methods
- Feature Importance analysis using tree-based models
- Algorithms: Decision Tree, XGboost
- Model tuning, cross-validation using Gridsearch
